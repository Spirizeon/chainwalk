## ChainWalk

**ChainWalk** is a vulnerable RAG-based web application lab designed for security research and CTF challenges. It simulates a misconfigured Langchain-ChatChat setup using Ollama as the backend and exposes a real-world path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2025-6855) in its assistant file upload API.

The lab allows users to exploit systemd service hijacking to gain remote access, capture flags, and understand the risks of insecure AI deployments in modern environments.
